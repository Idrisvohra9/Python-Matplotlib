# MatPlotLib:

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python, used for creating visualizations of data in a variety of formats,
including line plots, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, and more.

# Characteristics of Matplotlib:

1. Customization: Matplotlib allows extensive customization of plots, including labels, colors, line
styles, and more.

2. Integration: Matplotlib can be easily integrated with other Python libraries, such as NumPy and
Pandas, to plot data from those libraries.

3. Compatibility: Matplotlib can output plots in a variety of formats, including PNG, PDF, and SVG,
making it easy to include plots in documents or web pages.

4. Easy to use: Matplotlib has a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to create plots with just a few
lines of code.

5. High-quality output: Matplotlib can produce high-quality plots suitable for printing or publishing.

6. Large community: Matplotlib is widely used and has a large community of users and developers,
making it easy to find help and examples.



Most of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot submodule, and are usually imported under the plt alias:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

in order to plot a diagram we need x and y values by default we create a line diagram.

x and y values can be given with np.array([]).

and plot the two axis values with plt.plot(x,y).

There are other important methods of matplotlib such as:

plt.xlabel('angle') // To set the x axis label
plt.ylabel("sine") // To set the y axis label
plt.title("sine wave") // To set the title of the diagram/graph
plt.show() // to show the graph/diagram


# Figure

A Figure is a container for a plotting area. It contains one or more subplots, each of which can contain one or more
axes for plotting data. A figure can be created using the figure function from the matplotlib.pyplot module.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()

## Parameters :
Figsize (width,height) - tuple in inches
Dpi - Dots per inches
Facecolor - Figure patch facecolor
Edgecolor - Figure patch edge color
Linewidth - Edge line width


# Axes

An Axes represents an individual plotting area within a figure. An Axes contains two or three axis objects
(horizontal XAxis, vertical YAxis, and sometimes a ZAxis) and several methods for plotting data, such as plot,
scatter, hist, etc. An Axes is created within a Figure as a subplot.

## The add_axes method in Matplotlib is used to add an Axes to a Figure at a
specified location. The method takes several positional arguments: left, bottom,
width, and height, which specify the position and size (in float) of the Axes relative
to the Figure.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_axes([left, bottom, width, height])

## Parameters :
Labels: axis labels, title, and tick labels can be added using methods such as set_xlabel, set_ylabel, set_title,
set_xticks, set_yticks, etc.
Limits: The limits of the x and y axis can be set using methods such as set_xlim, set_ylim.
Legends: A legend can be added to the plot using the legend method, to provide a key for the data.
Grids: Grids can be added to the plot to make it easier to read, using the grid method.
Colormaps: Colormaps can be used to color data points based on a third value,
for example, to represent a third dimension in a 3D plot.
